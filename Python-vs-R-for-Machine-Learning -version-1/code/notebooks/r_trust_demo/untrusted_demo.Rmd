# R Notebook Trust Demo

This notebook demonstrates how saved HTML/JavaScript output behaves in **R Markdown (R Notebook)**.

Unlike Jupyter's explicit trust banner, R Markdown notebooks (rendered to HTML) will execute embedded JavaScript when the output HTML is opened in a browser or the RStudio Viewer.

> **Teaching goal:** Show that saved outputs can include active content. Only use trusted sources.

## Malicious-output cell (benign demo)

The chunk below emits a small JavaScript `alert()` via raw HTML. It uses only base R (`cat`) and knitr's `results='asis'` to place HTML directly into the document.

```{r echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
# Emits raw HTML/JS into the notebook output (benign demo)
cat("<script>alert('⚠️ This is why notebooks need a trust model! (R Markdown)');</script>")
```

## Instructions

1. Click **Knit** → **Knit to HTML Notebook** (or run: `rmarkdown::render('untrusted_demo.Rmd')`).  
2. RStudio will generate an `.nb.html` file (e.g., `untrusted_demo.nb.html`).  
3. Close the viewer, then reopen the `.nb.html` in your browser or RStudio Viewer.  
   - The JavaScript **alert** will appear without an explicit trust prompt.  
4. Discuss how this differs from Jupyter's trust model and why you should never open/render untrusted notebooks.
